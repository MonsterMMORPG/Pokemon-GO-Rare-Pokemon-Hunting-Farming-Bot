- Never gets soft banned because it always do human walking with the speed limit you have defined

## Why separate project?
- I have started as a separate project since i am still a total noob of GitHub code management system
- I have never collaborated previously with any other developers. Thus, I have to improve my skills first
- In future this project may discontinue if the all features here get added to Original Project

## How to use?
- First read the original Wiki here: https://github.com/NecronomiconCoding/NecroBot/wiki
- Download entire project
- Download sub module and copy paste into submodule folder
- Open the APP with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- Before starting the APP with F5, first go to Settings.cs which is located under PoGo.NecroBot.Logic
- Make all the settings you wish. Set your location, item counts, IV, evolve etc
- *
- Once you have the setup Click F5 run app first time then close it
- Then go to debug =>  config folder and enter your password username into auth.json file (do not worry i have checked files and these are secure)
- For deciding which rare Pokemon you want as priority, inside Settings.cs look for ```lstPriorityPokemon``` and change the PokemonId as you wish 
- *
- Now you need to install PokemonGo Map project in order to utilize our rare farming and priority farming
- PokemonGo Map github : https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map
- Follow the instructions there. Compose your config file
- In PokemonGo Map config file, you only have to put auth-service, username, password and location parameters rest is automatic
- Once you have installed and generated config file, double click runserver and it will start farming
- *
- Now you have to point your PokemonGo Map installation folder in our application
- In Settings.cs file change ```srPokemonGoMap_Directory``` variable to your installation folder 
- Ready to rock :D

## Common errors and solutions
- Make sure you have installed visual studio 2015
- Open the app once and if you get error restart again and check nuget packages
- Set PoGo.NecroBot.CLI app as start up project
- Make sure you have correctly set the PokemonGo Map directory location
- Make sure you edit Settings.cs before start. Or edit the generated file inside debug => config folder
- Right click and check installed nuget tools for all the projects
- Delete all text files in your debug folder and restart the app

## What is the logic behind the Pokemon and Rare Pokemon farming
- It reads the live data from the PokemonGo Map database
- Then calculates the shortest distance having Pokemon to your current location and go for hunting it
- However, if you have setup priority list and if there is a priority Pokemon, instead of going to shortest distance Pokemon, first it goes to priority Pokemon
- Then from that location, it scans the database and goes after the shortest location pokemon to you. 
- Unless, if there is an another priority Pokemon :)
- If you get under total 25 Poke Balls, it starts priority farming the PokeStops until you get over 50 Poke Balls

## Multiple Instance Farming
- For multiple instance farming, copy entire debug folder and paste it into another folder
- For each folder, set your password and username inside debug => config => auth file
- Each time you made changes, do the same operation for changes to be updated

## What is lack?
- It tries to upgrade already max upgraded Pokemon. Still trying to determine whether Pokemon is max upgraded or not :D
